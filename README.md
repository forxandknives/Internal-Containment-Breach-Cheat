# Internal-Containment-Breach-Cheat

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

A very large amount of this code was created from a Guided Hacking internal cheat tutorial. All I had to do was modify it enough to work in CB.

An internal cheat for SCP - Containment Breach that only works on v1.3.11.

You need an injector to inject the .dll into Containment Breach. I recommend the "Guided Hacking injector".

You also need to compile the .dll yourself.

Once you inject the .dll, a console window should pop up telling you the controls.
